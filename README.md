Dart binding for PDFlib

This code is part of my personal discovery of Dart language
Certainly a lot of stuff are not as they should be, but it works :-)

This package is a native bridge between Dart and PDFlib

All you need is :
- obtain dart sdk (https://www.dartlang.org/)
- obtain PDFlib C binding (full or lite version :
  http://www.pdflib.com/download/free-software/pdflib-lite-7/) 
- adapt Makefile to your pathes
- make
- launch helloPdf.dart (as a command line program) to verify that everything
  worked (you should obtain a hello.pdf file with some text and drawings)
- send patches / complains to me via github ...
